# Duplicate_Question_Pairs_Classification

This repository contains an NLP project focused on detecting duplicate questions from the Quora dataset. The project demonstrates core skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development for text classification tasks.

**Project Overview**

Objective: Identify pairs of questions from Quora that are semantically similar (duplicates).

**Dataset: Quora Question Pairs dataset.**

Techniques: Natural Language Processing (NLP), text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning architectures.

**Key Features**

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, text normalization).

Feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings, sentence similarity metrics).

Model training and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Clear documentation and modular code structure.

**Why This Project Stands Out**

Practical application of NLP in real-world scenarios.

Emphasis on reproducibility and clean, well-documented code.

Demonstrates proficiency in Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and common NLP libraries.

**How to Use**
